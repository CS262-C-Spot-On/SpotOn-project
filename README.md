# Spot On: Your Music Companion

Music enthusiasts crave intelligently curated playlists. Spotify is the most used music streaming platform. However, there are some essential features that Spotify is missing, and **Spot On** introduces these new features to its users. As a companion app for Spotify, **Spot On** will address the cravings of music enthusiasts by providing these features:

- **Specify playlist durations**: While Spotify allows users to create playlists, there is no option to specify a particular duration for playlists. With Spot On, users can create playlists by manually specifying the desired duration.

- **Generate playlists with text input**: Again, while users can create playlists on Spotify, they have limited control. With Spot On, users can type the kinds of songs they want to listen to, and the app will leverage AI to generate playlists based on the prompt. For instance, users can input "Eminem songs before 2008 and Ed Sheeran songs before 2015," and Spot On will generate playlists meeting those criteria.

Besides these highlight features, Spot On will also include additional features from Spotify that users enjoy:
- **Share Playlists**: Spot On will provide users with links to Spotify playlists that they can use to easily share generated playlists.

- **Personalize Filters**: To elaborate on the above feature, users can enter preferences such as genre, artist, and release dates to filter songs in the playlist. Furthermore, users can specify if they want songs for a specific theme such as Beach songs, Christmas songs, and so on.

- **Create User Profiles**: Create user profiles so users can store and categorize playlists within those profiles.

- **Suggest Songs**: Suggest new playlists to the user when new songs are released based on their current and past activity.

While Spotify has some of the features mentioned above, having all these features combined into one app, Spot On, will enhance the music listening experience of music enthusiasts.
