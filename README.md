# SpotOn: Your Music Companion

Music enthusiasts crave intelligently curated playlists. Spotify is the most used music streaming platform. However, there are some essential features that Spotify is missing, and **SpotOn** introduces these new features to its users. As a companion app for Spotify, **SpotOn** will address the cravings of music enthusiasts by providing these features:

- **Generate playlists with open-ended text input**: Again, while users can create playlists on Spotify, they have limited control. With SpotOn, users can type the kinds of songs they want to listen to, and the app will leverage AI to generate playlists based on the prompt. For instance, users can input "Eminem songs before 2008 and Ed Sheeran songs before 2015," and SpotOn will generate playlists meeting those criteria.

Besides these highlight features, SpotOn will also include additional features from Spotify that users enjoy:
- **Share Playlists**: SpotOn will provide users with links to Spotify playlists that they can use to easily share generated playlists.

- **Personalize Filters**: To elaborate on the above feature, users can enter preferences such as genre, artist, and release dates to filter songs in the playlist. Furthermore, users can specify if they want songs for a specific theme such as Beach songs, Christmas songs, and so on.

- **View Prompt History**: Users can view past prompts they searched for and when they seached those prompts.

- **Have AI generated playlist title and description**: SpotOn will provide an AI generated playlist title and a brief description relevant to the user's prompt.

While Spotify has some of the features mentioned above, having all these features combined into one app, SpotOn, will enhance the music listening experience of music enthusiasts.
